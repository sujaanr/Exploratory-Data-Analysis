# Homless-Shelter-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (INF2178A1.ipynb) that demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing a dataset related to Homeless Shelter Data. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and model diagnostics, employing a variety of Python libraries.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
The required Python libraries specified in the notebook
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/INF2178A1.git
Navigate to the cloned directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:

sh
Copy code
cd INF2178A1
jupyter notebook INF2178A1.ipynb
Or, if you prefer, you can open it in Google Colab by uploading the .ipynb file directly to your Colab workspace.

Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your notebook:

python
Copy code
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels bioinfokit
Features
The notebook includes the following key sections:

Library Imports: Importing essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

Data Reading: Loading the dataset from an Excel file.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Pre-processing the data to make it suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

Statistical Testing: Conducting ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and t-tests to analyze differences across groups.

Model Diagnostics: Assessing the assumptions of linear regression through residual analysis and diagnostic plots.

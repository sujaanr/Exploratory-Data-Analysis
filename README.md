# Homeless-Shelter-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`HomelessShelter.ipynb`) demonstrating a detailed approach to analyzing Homeless Shelter Data in the Greater Toronto Region. The notebook spans data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and model diagnostics, leveraging various Python libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Features

The notebook encompasses several key aspects:

- **Library Imports:** Importation of essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Data Reading:** How to load the dataset from an Excel file.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Steps taken to pre-process the data, making it ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations created to explore data distribution and the relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Testing:** Implementation of ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and t-tests to examine differences across various groups.
- **Model Diagnostics:** Techniques used to assess the assumptions of linear regression through residual analysis and diagnostic plots.
